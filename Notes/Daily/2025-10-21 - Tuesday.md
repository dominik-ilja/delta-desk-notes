Okay, the first things I need to do is follow-up with the developers.

1. Merge updates for updated emails to production. This is the update that includes more info about the error in the email.
2. Let me know once it is merged
3. I'll then sign up with my account and phone number. This should be successful. I'll sign-up with a different email to generate the error. I'll also test it with these other emails that previously failed to see what errors are generated.
