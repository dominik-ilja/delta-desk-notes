## Logs

The most important things for Delta Desk is:

- High customer service
- Delegating tasks to other people
- Getting and giving good requirements
- Understanding systems end-to-end and knowing what the most pressing issues are. Why? This allows us to effectively delegate to developers and communicate with the clients.
- Communicating with Josh to make sure he knows what's going on. We're building his trust in our abilities.
- Reduce the responsibilities of Josh

What are some questions that we can ask ourselves?

- What is our technology stacks that we're using for our front-end, back-end, and database
- What are third party services that we integrate with?
- What are the cloud providers being used?
- What automations occur in the system?

## 7:35-?

Okay, I have a meeting with Mikhail at 8:00 AM in about 25 minutes. I need to get materials ready for that. I'm going to send him a message, so that I can preemptively get a grasp on what he might need.

Okay, I need to write out what questions I have for Bao about these items in review. I should also look into creating some kind of automation of items.

What has been done for the clients and giving them updates.

### 8:30

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/tables/view-the-table-definition?view=sql-server-ver17

- Right-click table and select "Properties"

I guess some (or all) our tables don't have foreign key constraints?

Okay, so what we've learned about sending forms:

- Third Party Credit Card Authorization Form is now always linked to a corresponding form like UTF. Sending the "Third Party Credit Card Authorization Form" first then the "UTF Service Agreement" will result in the "Third Party Credit Card Authorization Form" being sent twice.
- If the "Third Party Credit Card Authorization Form" is completed and the "UTF Service Agreement" is sent again another email will be sent requesting signature of the "Third Party Credit Card Authorization Form".

### 9:35

Okay, so I want to go through some emails.

Okay, so sending the "UTF Service Agreement" first and the ordering of signing documents didn't matter.

## 10:00-?

When we send a form with "Send for E-Signature", the contact will receive an email with a Xodo form. The form can be sent as many times as NSDFC by doing the "Send for E-Signature" again. This will send an additional form with a new Xodo form. Each form that is sent is unique. 

This causes a situation where we only update the "Status" of the form when the most recent Xodo form is signed. Let's say we sent three forms:

- Email 1 at 10:00 AM
- Email 2 at 11:00 AM
- Email 3 at 11:30 AM

The status would only be updated if the Xodo form in email 3 is signed. If they signed any of the other forms, then the status in the CRM **WILL NOT** be updated.

---

A solution we'd like to try implementing is this. If the form has not changed since the last time it was sent for e-signature, then we should send an email that re-uses the same Xodo form that was previously sent. If the form has been changed since the last time, then we should generate a new form and should prevent the previous form from being signed. This is a notice that Xodo can give:

![[Attachments/Pasted image 20251030104950.png|200]]

We'd want to delete, cancel, or expire the previous form that was sent.

Let's look at examples of both flows:

In this example, we don't make any updates after initially sending: 

- Email 1 at 10:00 AM - First time sending the form - Creates "link 1"
- Email 2 at 11:00 AM - No updates to the form - Reuses "link 1"
- Email 3 at 11:30 AM - No updates to the form - Reuses "link 1"

In this example, we make updates after initially sending:

- Email 1 at 10:00 AM - First time sending the form - Creates "link 1"
- Email 2 at 11:00 AM - Updates made to the form - Creates "link 2"
- Email 3 at 11:30 AM - Updates made to the form - Creates "link 3"

## Emails

Hello,

Here's a summary of what we decided to do from the meeting:

We'll keep a single events tab
We'll replace the "Popular Events" with "Featured Events"
We'll replace the "Latest Events" heading with "All Events"
We'll remove the "Archived Events" section since this is unused in the new setup
We'll add the categories "Upcoming Events" and "Previous Events" to filter the events by
We'll make more fields optional in the event post this way you don't have to add anything you don't need. Those fields are:
    Time of an event
    Duration of an event
    CTA Box
We'll add some additional fields:
    A field to hide a post. This way you can hide an event that has a follow-up post about the hidden event
    A field to mark an event as featured
    A field to say what order the featured events are in
We'll add a section called "Gallery" at the bottom of the post. The idea is to have the images layout similar to what's done in Pinterest
Clicking an image will open it in a modal so that you can go through the gallery

If I missed anything, please let me know!

Regards,
