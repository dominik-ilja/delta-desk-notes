Okay, I have 1 hour and 46 minutes left in the day. What is most important for me to do?

I need to assign Mostofa and Zulqarnain additional tasks.

I would also like to start more thoroughly understanding the CRM.

## 19:30

Okay, I need to get the tasks for Mostofa. They need to be frontend tasks. The focus will be FIN and NSDFC. Let's see. Zulqarnain and Mostofa will be competing for tasks. I'd like to give them at least 5 things each to work on.
