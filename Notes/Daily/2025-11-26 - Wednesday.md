It is hard to estimate many of these as once we get into the details, the estimates change.  We find better ways to do things, we encounter issues, etc.  However, here are the current estimates:

Hello everyone,

I wanted to share our priorities:

1. Performance and loading time of pages – ongoing – no estimate – the specific task about speeding up searches on Contacts based on additional filters we are aiming for next Friday Dec. 12
2. Migration of admin features and login – ongoing – will require FIN testing – TBD we will get back to you
    1. RIA admin features
    2. V1 admin features
3. Document loading improvements and fixes
    1. Keeping old site docs and new site docs in sync – Dec 5
    2. Loading missing docs to new site - TBD
4. Universal search improvements – next version Dec. 5
5. Global search input improvements – next version Dec. 5
6. Firms and 13F data fixes – Friday Dec. 12
7. User activity tracking improvements - TBD

Hey Matt,

It can be difficult to give strict estimates at times. This is because once we're in the thick of it we encounter new issues, find better ways to do things, etc. However, this is what we're aiming for:

1. **Performance and loading time of pages** – This will be an ongoing task. A specific task will be speeding up searches for contacts. Currently, having certain filters applied will cause a big slowdown. We're expecting this for December 12th.
2. **Migration of admin features and login** - The goal of this to is deprecate and move away from the classic and ria versions of the site. We're currently migrating the admin features from the classic site. I will need to get back to you on an estimate for this. As of right now, there's 32 items on the list.
3. **Document loading improvements and fixes** - We expect that keeping the documents in sync between the classic and data site should be finished on December 5th. Other tasks related to this will be determined later on.
4. **Universal search and the Global search input**  – The next versions are expected to be completed on December 5th.
5. **Firms and 13F data fixes** – Expected for December 5th.
6. **User activity tracking improvements & Institutional side of Salesforce integration** - Will be determined at a later date.

One thing I would like to ask of your team is to help us in identifying search filters that are slow. On the different listing pages, if you could use try out different filters to see what has a reasonable load versus what doesn't, would be helpful to us.

Regards,
