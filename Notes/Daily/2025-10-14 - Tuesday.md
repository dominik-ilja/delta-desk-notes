**Progress and blockers**

- "How's `[specific task]` going? On track to finish by `[date]`?"
- "Are you blocked on anything I can help with?"
- "Do you have what you need to move forward, or are there any unknowns?"

**Clarity and requirements**

- "Does the task make sense, or is anything unclear about what's needed?"
- "Have you run into any edge cases or scenarios we didn't discuss?"
- "Is the acceptance criteria clear, or should we refine it?"

**Timeline reality checks**

- "Does the estimate still feel right, or is this turning out more complex than expected?"
- "What do you think you'll have done by end of day/tomorrow?"

**Heads-up questions**

- "Anything coming up that might need client input or decisions from me?"
- "Did you discover anything while working on this that we should tell the client about?"

**Better approach: Async updates** Instead of asking these daily, consider a brief daily standup message in Slack/your PM tool where developers share:

- What they finished yesterday
- What they're working on today
- Any blockers

Then you ask follow-up questions only when needed. This respects their focus time while keeping you informed.

The goal is staying informed without becoming a bottleneck or distraction yourself. Quality of communication matters more than frequency.
