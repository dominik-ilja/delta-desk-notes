## 7:57

Okay, I want to start compiling the reports for our clients at the beginning of the week.

<time>8:01</time>
Okay, what template do we use for our sprint list?

<time>8:07</time>
I've gone ahead and added in a template and copied over the items ready for review into the new sprint.

<time>9:00</time>
I've been doing the following:

- Updating the FIN searches sprint
- Getting questions answered by developers
- Writing out questions/information I need and reaching out to the appropriate people

There's about 45 items in this sprint. Zulqarnain is saying that he's done with his task which is a bit unbelievable to me. I'm trying to get him to clarify himself.

Vu has been adding items to his project and there's been updates there.

I'm going to be moving onto NSDFC then OMS. I want to make sure everything is making progress.

Zulqarnain and Bao are saying they may run out of tasks soon.
