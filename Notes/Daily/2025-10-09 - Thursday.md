### Email to Natalie

- ==Added in the ability to export workflows from the dashboard==
- Fixed some bugs
    - Sidebar couldn't be scrolled on smaller screens
    - "Snooze Date" field would remain visible when it shouldn't
    - Email filter in "Communications" tab of the contact profile wouldn't filter properly at times

In Progress:

- I need a length of time to send reminder emails. I sent Josef an email about this. 
- We're very close to being finished with the notification that pops up in the CRM when a call is received, so that you can open the contact's file.
- Updates to note editing and adding in responses to the note.
- 3rd party authorization form investigation

Up next:

- Eliminating N/A statuses - We have no N/A statuses for Intake, Sales, Processing, Accounting, and Disability Discharge. My plan is to work from the workflows with the least amount of N/A statuses to the most
