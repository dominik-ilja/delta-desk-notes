## 4:53

Okay, we're starting our day now. I want to do the following:

<span class="placeholder">Tasks moved to agenda note</span>

**5:11** — Okay, I've moved over tasks to the Agenda note.

I'm wanting to figure out how to maintain notes of different bugs we are tracking and other things like documentation.

**5:41** — I've sent questions and other things to Josh/Luke
**5:56** — I've installed ClickUp on my computer.

How I would like to do our task management is having a single list that contains all the tasks. This would be our "Backlog" of tasks.

**6:20** — I'm working through the different tasks we have for NSDFC.
**6:28** — There's a total of 36 items overdue in NSDFC right now.

I'm looking at these statuses for NSDFC. The 5 overdue urgent items are all assigned to Josh Jennings. These are reports which are just SQL queries.

- Contract Received Report. -> 20250711 - Contract Received Report
- AC – 2nd Agreement Report.

**6:39** — I'll need to get confirmation that these have been done. I think It'll be a good idea to go through and get a handle on these overdue tasks.
**6:44** — Okay, so I want to figure out where to keep my thoughts as I work through these things related to NSDFC, FIN Searches, etc. I'm thinking something along the lines of having a note which contains the logs
**7:07** — Updated structure for the CRM project and updated the bug descriptions.
