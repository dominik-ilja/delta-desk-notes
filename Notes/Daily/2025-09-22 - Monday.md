I've gotten the tasks for each developer that are in a sprint.

Zulqarnain:
```
Hello, I hope you had a good weekend. I wanted to check in and see how you are doing. I've added in different tasks for the week.

- FIN Searches
- NSDFC
- OMS
  
I know one of your tasks I need to provide information for. One of the big tasks, which Josh mentioned in his powerpoint, is the "Application UI Updates - Responsiveness and Consistency". This will entail going through each individual page of FIN Searches.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
```

One of the big tasks, which Josh mentioned in his powerpoint, is the "Add admin controls/permissions" for FIN Searches. This is one of the things we need to do to migrate over FIN Searches to the new site. The other one which has a time constraint is the Orical item.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

- FIN Searches (Sprint 2) - 4
- OMS (Sprint 1) - 3
  
One of the big tasks, which relates to what Josh mentioned in his powerpoint, is the "Rebuild frontend pages" task for OMS. I would like there to be tasks created for each individual page that needs to be created. This gives Josh and I visibility into the progress of the project.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
