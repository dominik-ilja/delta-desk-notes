<time>8:19</time>
Started work at 7:05 AM today. I've created a new flow for dealing with developer tasks that they need me to look at. I will add those tasks to my personal priority list.


we have some automation functions that run every day to check data, send email reminder to the clients.  
one of them checks the Contacts that have upcoming payment but don't have payment profile and it will send an email reminder to Contact's emaill address to ask them create payment profile (this task [https://app.clickup.com/t/86aax3vud](https://app.clickup.com/t/86aax3vud))  
but we miss a condition when checking the upcoming payment. the upcoming payment should be an actual payment. but all of the payments of that contact are estimated (I hope you understand the actual and estimated concept)  
so, my fix is to add the condition to check if at least one of the upcoming payments is actual.  
please let me know if it doesn't make sense…
