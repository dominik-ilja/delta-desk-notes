### Statuses

I'm thinking about how we should separate out different types of tasks

What different statuses do we currently have and what should we do differently? ClickUp offers four sections:

- Not started
- Active
- Done
- Closed

These are statuses I'm seeing that we currently have:

- Not started
    - New Issue
    - Backlog
- Active
    - Ready to Start
    - In Progress
    - Internal QA
    - Client QA
    - Blocked
    - Dev Needs Info -> Needs Info
    - Needs Planning
- Done
    - Cancelled
    - Ready for Deployment
- Closed
    - Closed

---

If a task is no longer needed, it looks like we apply a "CANCELLED" status to it. If a task is cancelled or no longer relevant, then it should get a tag of cancelled, a status of closed, and moved to an appropriate list

- Not started
    - NOT STARTED
    - NEEDS INFO
    - READY TO START
- Active
    - IN PROGRESS
- Done
    - READY FOR DEPLOYMENT
- Closed
    - CLOSED

Okay, I'm resetting an organizing my tasks for the next around of work.
