## Aiden Review

- [x] General
    - [x] When I give you a pixel value, make sure you translate that to a rem value
    - [x] All content should a max-width of 1312px or smaller. Some examples: the cards on the home page, the benefits section on the home page, the content within the footer. Please make sure to keep an eye out for this.
    - [x] There's a bunch of little inconsistencies between the spacings used in the design and what's used on the site. Please pay attention to what the values are used for each section.
    - [x] Hero sections do not take up the full screen height. This causes the hero images to not sit correctly on the background. Use the heights in the design to have the background images layout nicer.
- [x] Components
    - [x] Button 
        - [x] Only the header button has a padding-block of 10px. All other primary buttons have a padding-block of 15px.
        - [x] The button hover is a lighter color rather than a darker. It turns to `#FFCF54`
    - [x] Site Footer
        - [x] Content should have a max-width of 1312px
    - [x] Carousel
        - [x] Should wrap around to the first item once it hits the end.
    - [x] The mobile menu slides out of the header. It doesn't cover the whole screen
- [x] Company Page
    - [x] The text is aligned to the bottom not the top in the design: [[Attachments/Pasted image 20251113072802.png]]
    - [x] For these bio cards just add a padding to the right that's the size of the button. This way you don't have to use widths with percentages: [[Attachments/Pasted image 20251113072954.png]]
    - [x] For the animation of the bio cards, can be do an opacity fade over a slide-in from the bottom. The padding should also be the same as the card it is overlaying. The bio card description doesn't align with the original cards text. The padding of the original card is 20px while the inner is 30px for smaller screen sizes. They have adjusted the padding for larger screens.
    - [x] For your image, I want you to use a different background image for the mobile. Crop the original image they gave us so that it is centered. Once, you hit tablet, then switch to the right aligned image.
    - [x] The hero section doesn't take up the full screen height. The heights are 533px for tablet, 700px for desktop 1+. This should help with the positioning of the background image. You can shift the image to the left slightly to prevent it from clipping 
    - [x] Don't switch the hero section from mobile to tablet until you hit 810px wide
- [x] Home Page
    - [x] Please look through each section again and make sure the spacing is exactly what's in the design at each breakdown.
    - [x] All the buttons should have a height of 49px due to `15px` padding top and bottom and `25px` padding on the left and right.
    - [x] Massive gap between the cards in "The Challenges" section and "The Solutions" section (mobile)
    - [x] The cards in "The Challenges"
        - [x] Should have a max-width of 1312px
        - [x] Should have a column-gap of 24px
        - [x] Spacing between cards is using the incorrect values (mobile, tablet)
    - [x] "The Solutions" section
        - [x] The cards that scroll into view should have the same height as the card on the left.
        - [x] The gap between the cards should be 24px
        - [x] The cards don't scroll until desktop 1 breakpoint
        - [x] Text isn't centered aligned in "The Solutions" card (mobile)
    - [x] Marquee section
        - [x] Should have max-width of 1312px
        - [x] Is missing other images. Currently, there's only two.
    - [x] "The Benefits" section
        - [x] "The Benifits" is spelled incorrectly
        - [x] "The Benefits" tag has a spacing of 25px between it and the heading
        - [x] The spacing between the heading and the cards is 60px not 48px for desktop-2
        - [x] The container should have a max-width of 1312px
        - [x] Padding of cards is off (all breakpoints)
        - [x] Margin bottom between images and heading is 40x not 24px
- [x] Solution page
    - [x] Blue is wrong color for "IT teams are..." text it should be `#57C7F1`
    - [x] Text following "IT teams are..." is wrong size (mobile)
    - [x] Linear gradient in "Aiden ends that chaos." heading is `0deg` not `to top`
    - [x] Text following the heading is wrong size (mobile)
    - [x] Hero section
        - [x] This shouldn't be the full page height. Use the heights in the design and we'll have better success with the background images laying out properly
        - [x] Text following heading doesn't get bigger
    - [x] "How We Do It" section
        - [x] The padding isn't correct and is causing the cards to be more squashed (mobile)
        - [x] Tags like "Fragmentation" aren't centered (mobile)
        - [x] Cards like "Fragmented Tools..." have backgrounds when they shouldn't (mobile)
        - [x] Update the images at the bottom
        - [x] "Plus" bullets in cards are not left aligned (tablet)
        - [x] Reduce line height of text in cards (desktop)
        - [x] Too much padding within container that causes cards to get smushed (desktop)
        - [x] Clicking the carousel button should loop around once at the end
- [x] Customers page
    - [x] Hero section 
        - [x] Needs updated with proper background
        - [x] Responsive font sizes
    - [x] Testimonial cards
        - [x] The cards should be wider (mobile, tablet)
    - [x] Numbers that speak volumes
        - [x] The font sizes are incorrect for the headers and percentages (mobile)
        - [x] Should have two columns (tablet)
        - [x] "Numbers that speak volumes" is centered aligned rather than aligned to the top
- [x] Resources page
    - [x] Pay attention to how the padding changes when hitting different break points
    - [x] Need to add filtering through tags and search
    - [x] Hero section
        - [x] Same commentary as the other hero sections
    - [x]  Cards
        - [x] The height of the tag in the card should be 23px. You can reduce the padding or set the height.
        - [x] Padding after cards should be 100px (mobile)
        - [x] Max width of 1312px
- [x] Book a demo page
    - [x] Form should use actual reCAPTCHA
    - [x] The text "Aiden Technologies, Inc. needs the contact..." should be 10px not 12px
    - [x] Testimonial cards and "Numbers" that speak volumes have the same feedback as described above

## Mikhail Meeting

- Zulqarnain pushed qa -> ==Take a look at this==
- SP = Stored Procedure -> Publishing an end point to run the stored procedure -> They already have a project to update RIA data. He'll add it to that project. It is called something different. Mikhail will send it after the call.
- He added the column to table and the response. Sometimes we won't have enough fields in order to generate a description. It is a simple formula. It is not an AI generated field. ==We should bring this up to Josh== -> ==Follow-up with Vu== - There are going to be some 
- FS Activity - It'll work the same as the stored procedure. He'll create an endpoint and he'll call it two times a day.
- ==Add to the CRD Number ticket that you sent the information to Matt==.

CRD numbers and tickers

## Josef Meeting

- How the money is showing up for accounting
