We are not storing the selected service in the database for the generated form. A service can be a recertification based agreement or not. So, in order to implement the logic defined here: https://deltadesk.slack.com/archives/C08A20K9M4H/p1760579654146879?thread_ts=1760579598.098589&cid=C08A20K9M4H, we need to know the service. What Bao is suggesting is to create a new column in the database to store the type of service. With this new data, we'd be able to implement the logic. Currently, we will not be able to. #Todo 

Something that will come up is this will only work for newly created forms. We could read the previous forms and find out what service it was for, but is probably more work than it is worth. #Todo

Created by "Trickle". Mikhail will need to review these kinds of plans. He'll provide more information on what is going on with this.

## 11:04

Okay, so I've got about 57 minutes to get some tasks done. My focus will be assigning tasks for FIN Searches.

What I'm going to do is separate the tasks by priority.

Tasks completed for FIN = 18

## 13:34

Okay, team. This is what I have as tasks that we should prioritize for FIN when you log on tomorrow. The goal is to be able to report good progress to FIN for the meeting tomorrow. Thank you in advance!
