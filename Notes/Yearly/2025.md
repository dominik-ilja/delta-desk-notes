Overview of my main responsibilities for Josh:

1. Making sure the developers are loaded up with tasks and clear on the requirements
2. Gathering requirements from users (we'll do this together for the first 6 months or so)
3. Testing the developer results and communicating that to the users

The main focuses are getting FIN Searches and NSDFC CRM wrapped up, so that we can focus on the OMS.
