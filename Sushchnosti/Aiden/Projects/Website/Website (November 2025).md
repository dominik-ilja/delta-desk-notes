We hope that you are having a great afternoon.   
  
Please find a link to the website design file below. We have given you access to be able to make a copy, so let us know if you have any problems accessing it.  
  
Just a few quick notes for Josh and team:  
• We have included 4 resolutions for each page.  
• On Tablet and Mobile, we have suggested removing some interactions and instead suggest stacking those elements (ie. the interaction on the Solutions Page).  
• Resources Main Page – The "Load More" button might not be needed for launch. [@Cindy Moen](mailto:cmoen@edgemarketinginc.com "mailto:cmoen@edgemarketinginc.com") Can you provide Josh with the proper links of what articles will be on this page?  
• Resources Single Page – Please add an option to "Hide" the image in the Hero (not all pages will have images).  
• Resources Single Page – Please also add an option to "Hide" the _"Ransomware recovery, anywhere, anytime!"_ image block (this will be an image that can link off to other pages... but might not be needed for launch).

• Company *Leadership" & "Advisory Board" – Bios of each individual are in the clickable actions.
