### Where do archived tasks go?

Archived tasks are hidden from the view. They stay in the same list, folder, space, etc. Wherever it was originally is where it will be.

﻿[How to view archived items](https://app.clickup.com/90131578041/v/dc/2ky45f5t-4753/2ky45f5t-1293?block=block-fe3d362b-9c5b-429e-add9-d88342584f9c)

### How to view the activity/tasks of an individual

In the top-left corner, you can click the name of the space in our case "Delta Desk" then "People".

This will show you the list of people who are in your workspace. Clicking on their name will open a panel which allows you to see all their tasks.

## Outlook

Having multiple conditions in a rule will act like an "AND" rather than an "OR".

### How to add rules to a shared mail box

Give yourself full access to the shared inbox. In the new Outlook, go to “Settings > Your accounts. You should be able to update the account if you have the permissions.

![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250930193151.png]]

Go to the web client at [https://outlook.office365.com/mail/](https://outlook.office365.com/mail/) and click your profile in the upper right corner. Click “Open another mailbox”, type in the shared email address, and click “Open”.

You’ll now be able to add rules as normal. These rules will only be viewable from this account.

### How to add an email signature
