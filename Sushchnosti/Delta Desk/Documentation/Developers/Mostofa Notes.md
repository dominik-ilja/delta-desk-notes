Let me know when this is ready and I'll test it. Do we have a QA site for the ria.finsearches?

Who is the developer reviewing this?
- 86acnj29y - "Highlighting" the sorting direction in table columns  

Let me know what the issue was with this. I believe Zulqarnain mentioned before that it was related to the Mantine library.

I'm running out of things to give you. Let's work on doing the following:  

- Tell me what is left for the OMS project and what I need to do on my end
- We have a project for a company called "Aiden" coming up in a couple weeks. We can start getting things ready for this project.
- You could look into ways that we could improve our frontend processes. For example, how could we automate the testing of our UI.

>Great job on the review. This is very helpful. It looks like he's already working on implementing the changes. It looks like I created a duplicate task, so I'll need to connect those.

>I think this task needs to be re-thought. There's a ton of different formats a phone number can be in. I think it is un-reasonable for this to be done on the frontend. I do see other phone numbers like this, "+86-10-6535-4715" which I think is unreasonable to have you try to account for. It would be a waste of time.

> Since I don’t have access to the old site, I faced some significant challenges while integrating the API, as there are many dependent APIs. Bao has been helping me with this, and I’ve also been referring to the previous codebase.  
> Sorry it’s taking a bit more time than I expected.
