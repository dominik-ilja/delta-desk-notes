> Since I don’t have access to the old site, I faced some significant challenges while integrating the API, as there are many dependent APIs. Bao has been helping me with this, and I’ve also been referring to the previous codebase.  
> Sorry it’s taking a bit more time than I expected.

He needs to get access to the old site for the OMS project?
