### Tasks

- Move the universal search description generator into the Fin API [86acar692]
- Manage Terminated firms [86accvkpp]

### Logs

first 103 records from this file, I'm not sure how this file was created, it seems to me someone of nsdfc approved it

I found some departments with the names they provided

```
ASSCR - FKM  select * from Organizations where OrganizationName like '%ASSCR%'  
ATU 1342 - FKM  
SBA – FKM  
BUGS – NSDFC select * from OrganizationDepartments where DepartmentName like '%BUGS%'  
Dream Charter – NSDFC select * from OrganizationDepartments where DepartmentName like '%Dream%'  
National Health and Law Program (NHeLP) – NSDFC  
Nuasin Charter – NSDFC select * from OrganizationDepartments where DepartmentName like '%Nuasin%'
```

Can you use db ?
