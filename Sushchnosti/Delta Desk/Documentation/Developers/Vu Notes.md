I'd like for us to knock this out ASAP. I'm expecting it to be a quick update. Once you complete this, I'll be able to get with Orical to go over things.

- [x] Follow-up on his comments

- I'm waiting for confirmation on the New Monthly Payment logic from Josh.
- Do you mean that whenever the New Monthly Payment is 0, we don't allow adding a new form—or just don't allow adding a new Group Advantage Agreement form, or any form that has a New Monthly Payment field in it?
- From my research, Sanity allows you to set up uploads for MP3 files. Please help me confirm what is the icon in "Add the ability to upload an MP3 file and an icon", what we should name it for this (in the Content list), and how the UI should look.
