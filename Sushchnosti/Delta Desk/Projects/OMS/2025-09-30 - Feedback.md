# 2025-09-30 - Feedback

- General
    - The URL scheme doesn't make sense to me. Why is everything nested under `/dashboard`?
    - Light/dark mode doesn't work
- Global sidebar
    - Remove "Menu" text
    - My preference would be to make padding consistent at `1rem`
- Tables
    - We could add column filtering
    - We could remove the pagination buttons if there's only a single page
- /dashboard/home
    - What information would a client want to see here?
- /dashboard/clients/active
    - ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250930164856.png]]
        - Since there's limited items I don't think there needs to be a menu label
    - ![[Attachments/20250930-2054-39.9064496.mp4]]
        - There's no indicator on how a table column is being sorted. Show only the "Up chevron" when sorting ascending and the "Down chevron" when sorting descending.
        - The sorting doesn't cycle completely. You can only click the column title to sort twice then it becomes unresponsive
        - Loading skeleton when sorting don't conform to the cell spacing and spill over

        - Since there's limited items I don't think there needs to be a menu label
    - ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250930165922.png]]
        - Different grays are being used
    - ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250930170018.png]]
        - "No results found." doesn't stay in center. This could result in a user losing visibility of this text completely.
    - ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250930170112.png]]
        - If a button doesn't have a label, then it needs a tooltip to say what it is
    - ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250930170154.png]]
        - Format is broken at 1200px and smaller
    - ![[Attachments/20250930-2103-06.2118763.mp4]]
        - Count flickers when updating table. I'd recommend this value staying stable then changing once new data is loaded in.
    - ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250930170520.png]]
        - Bottom border doesn't expand the full width
    - ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250930171005.png]]
        - "Active filters:" could be reduced to "Filters:"
    - Can't resize column widths despite having the icon saying I can
    - We could remove the "Reset" button. It could be placed after the "filter tags". It could be named something like "Clear" and be styled like a link. Have it be a blue color.
        - ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250930173352.png]]
    - We could remove the second line and reduce the margin after the filter tags
        - Before: ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250930172957.png]]
        - After: ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250930172925.png]]
    - ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250930174549.png]]
        - The blue is too light
- /dashboard/clients/details/{id}
    - ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250930175822.png]]
        - I don't know what this information is without labels
    - ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250930175858.png]]
        - I would add the id of the client to the breadcrumbs
    - ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250930180241.png]]
        - I would turn these into tabs across the top
    - ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250930180328.png]]
        - I would turn the switches into checkboxes and put them after the inputs
    - We need some kind of indicator to let a client know that they're trying to leave a page where changes are not saved
- /dashboard/clients/summary
    - ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250930175325.png]]
        - This isn't clear what this is filtering for to me
        - Date display. I would render `2025-09-01` as `September 1, 2025` or `Sep 1, 2025` if there's less room
- /dashboard/firms
    - ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250930181038.png]]
        - These could just say "Teams" and "Clients"
    - ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250930181125.png]]
        - Switches can be replaced by checkboxes
        - The placeholder text could be changed/removed
        - Labels could be re-written to prevent ambiguity. For example, when I see "Is Broker?" followed by "Broker", I think the UI is broken because I think that if I say "yes" to "Is Broker?" then this input will appear. I know that it is asking for the broker of the firm and "Is Broker" is asking if the firm is a broker. We could change the labels for the switches to "Firm is a broker", "Firm is a custodian", and "Firm is a trading desk".
    - ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250930181616.png]]
        - The filter button isn't appropriate for a dropdown that is for controlling the columns of a table
- /dashboard/firms/{id}
    - ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250930180826.png]]
        - I don't like the look of these switches. I think they could be converted into checkboxes and grouped after the other inputs.
    - ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250930180926.png]]
        - These don't feel appropriate to be used as cards
- /dashboard/teams
    - ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250930181717.png]]
        - This modal has two columns while the firm modal is a single column
- /dashboard/teams/{id}
    - ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250930181816.png]]
        - advisor card and advisor field are different
- /dashboard/advisors/create
    - ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250930181925.png]]
        - Creating an advisor is even more different than firms and teams
- /dashboard/strategies
    - ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20250930182019.png]]
        - I would spell out PM. I'm assuming this is "Portfolio Manager". I would match the labels and the table columns. I would probably say "Portfolio Manager" and "Backup Portfolio Manager".
