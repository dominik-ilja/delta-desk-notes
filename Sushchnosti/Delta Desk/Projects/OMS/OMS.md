https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E0ES9QGFD5h5lYGQ1YPJshGQtdmLrv132QOImTIn66Y/edit?gid=0#gid=0 - Spreadsheet of all the pages that need worked on

## General

- Our system isn't a trading system. Carrick trades through Bloomberg. Bloomberg routers the orders.
- How much should each person get? We solve this with the OMS.
- We shadow what each person is supposed to get. Luke's spreadsheet was used to reconcile that. [[Sushchnosti/Carrick Lane/People/Tim Knowles|Tim Knowles]]'s spreadsheet is in sync with our system.
