# Passaic Partners

We maintain their website for them. Currently, we have three things that are added on a recurring basis:

- Cross-Asset Volatility
- Podcast

They have an email distribution that has different material coming out each week. The schedule looks like this:

- Week 1 - Market Commentary
- Week 2 - Fact Sheets
- Week 3 - Cross-Asset Volatility
- Week 4 - Podcast
