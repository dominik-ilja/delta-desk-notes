# Passaic Partners

We maintain their website for them. Currently, we have three things that are added on a recurring basis:

- Market Commentary
- Cross-Asset Volatility
- Podcast

They have an email distribution that has different material coming out each week. The schedule looks like this:

- Week 1 - Market Commentary
- Week 2 - Fact Sheets
- Week 3 - Cross-Asset Volatility
- Week 4 - Podcast

The podcast is automatically populated with the https://rss.com/ API. The end point is `https://media.rss.com/macroandvolatility/feed.xml`
