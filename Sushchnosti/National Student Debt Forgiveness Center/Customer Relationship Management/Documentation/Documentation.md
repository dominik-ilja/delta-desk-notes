- What are the high level concepts we need to understand about the organization/project?

NSDFC makes money through performing various services for people. These services being offered is essentially them doing the paperwork for people to get into these programs.

Where did he get the formulas from?

## Archive

A "Notice of Cancellation" must have two pages. This is a compliance rule.

**From Bao:**
I'll try to answer as much as possible, based on my knowledge. but I believe these are related to business logic mostly, right? Luke should have more detailed views for you  

- What is a sponsor in relation to an Organization?
    - in our system, we only know which person is a sponsor of an Organization. we don't use it anywhere. so it's just kind of information
- What is a contact within our system?
- What is a "File"?
    - Contact and File are the same, I believe. basically, NSDFC is a system related to consulting / assistance services for people with student loans, helping them understand and apply for **student loan forgiveness, repayment plans, consolidations.** when a person applies to any programs, we'll create a Contact record ("File") for him/her and the client (NSDFC staff) will do some processes for that Contact - "File"
- What is forbearance?
    - Forbearance is a temporary pause or reduction in required payments that the system allows a Contact, usually because the Contact is experiencing financial hardship.
- What is a servicer?
    - the company that manages Contact's loan on a day-to-day basis
- What is the dummy contact ID we use?
    - here is my dummy contact: 17214
    - Luke's dummy contact 17179
    - you probably can create a dummy for your own. but let's confirm with Luke
- What is a workflow?
    - firstly, I think you should know NSDFC has some departments and each department will be responsible for some processes that I mentioned above. a workflow is a step that reflects what is going on with a Contact (File). for example, when a Contact is created, the Intake department will have an appointment with that Contact to discuss something and in our system, there is a status that will be created under Intake workflow to help us know that progress. when Intake finishs the appoitment, they will request a FSAFile, a new status will be created - FSA request, etc.
- What is a recertification?
    - we have some concepts that are related to "Recertification" - recertification services, recertifications, etc.. but I'm not really familiar with them. sorry I can't provide more information for this question
- What does the number for "Age of Status" represent?
    - it's the number of days between the Date Created of a status and today
