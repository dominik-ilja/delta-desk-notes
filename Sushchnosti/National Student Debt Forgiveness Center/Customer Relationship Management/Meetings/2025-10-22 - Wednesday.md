# NSDFC Meeting - 2025-10-22 - Wednesday


- Figure out what the original ask was for the organization
- What was the original email for this? - "Groups For Utilization Reports"

Okay, so there's two things with this. Josef was wanting to do a pipeline report. He was trying to get the following entries out:

- ASSCR - FKM
- ATU 1342 - FKM
- SBA – FKM
- BUGS – NSDFC
- Dream Charter – NSDFC
- National Health and Law Program (NHeLP) – NSDFC
- Nuasin Charter – NSDFC

However, he wasn't able to find them. This was in the "Groups For Utilization Reports" email. We had a meeting with him and he sent Josh a list. This list was included in the "Q4 - GROUP updated sheet" email. This was the list: [[Sushchnosti/National Student Debt Forgiveness Center/Customer Relationship Management/Assets/Q4 - Group Updated Sheet|Q4 - Group Updated Sheet]]

In our database, we have two tables relating to this:

- dbo.OrganizationDepartments
- dbo.Organizations

We needed to go in and add any Organizations that were not found. The list doesn't specify if the group should be an organization or a department within an organization.
