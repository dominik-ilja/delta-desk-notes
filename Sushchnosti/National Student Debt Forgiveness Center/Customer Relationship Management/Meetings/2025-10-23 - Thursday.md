# NSDFC Meeting - Thursday, October 23, 2025

- Figure out what the original ask was for the organization
- What was the original email for this? - "Groups For Utilization Reports"
- Can you add in any missing records?  Set the IsSponsored flag = 1 (from Josh)

Okay, so there's two things with this. Josef was wanting to do a pipeline report. He was trying to get the following entries out:

- ASSCR - FKM
- ATU 1342 - FKM
- SBA – FKM
- BUGS – NSDFC
- Dream Charter – NSDFC
- National Health and Law Program (NHeLP) – NSDFC
- Nuasin Charter – NSDFC

However, he wasn't able to find them. This was in the "Groups For Utilization Reports" email. We had a meeting with him and he sent Josh a list. This list was included in the "Q4 - GROUP updated sheet" email. This was the list: [[Sushchnosti/National Student Debt Forgiveness Center/Customer Relationship Management/Assets/Q4 - Group Updated Sheet|Q4 - Group Updated Sheet]]

In our database, we have two tables relating to this:

- `dbo.OrganizationDepartments`
- `dbo.Organizations`

We needed to go in and add any Organizations that were not found. The list doesn't specify if the group should be an organization or a department within an organization. This is what we need to ask:

- The list that you sent can you specify if the Group Acronym is an organization or a department within an organization?

## Questions

- [ ] In the [[Sushchnosti/National Student Debt Forgiveness Center/Customer Relationship Management/Assets/Q4 - Group Updated Sheet|list]] that you sent, can you specify what are organizations and what are a sub-category of an organization.
- [ ] Can only the sub-organization be considered sponsored and not the whole organization? For example, New York City Charter Schools (NYCCS) is currently not considered sponsored, but it's sub-organization Amber Charter School (East-Harlem) is sponsored. An issue I noticed is that only the way to specify if the sponsor is NSDFC or FKM is on the organization not its department.
- [ ] Could you also take a look at this mapping to see if this is correct: [[Attachments/Pasted image 20251022140943.png]]


- [ ] Another fix please: Organization page. We need to code this a little better. 1st Column should be "Group Acronym"  Column 2 should be "Group Name". I sent you the list previously. Let me know if you have any questions -> Could you tell me the exact column names you wanted to rename? You can reorder the columns and want to make sure we're on the same page. Also, are you referring to the page at "/dashboard/organizations" that lists all the organizations or the page that you see when you click on an organization. For example: "/dashboard/organization/109".
