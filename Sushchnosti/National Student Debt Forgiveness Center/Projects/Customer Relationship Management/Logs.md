# Logs
## Thursday, September 11, 2025

**Overdue Items:** 36
- **Urgent:** 5
- **High:** 5
- **Normal:** 24
- **No Priority:** 2

The oldest item is **July 18, 2025** almost two months ago.

I'm looking at these statuses for NSDFC. The 5 overdue urgent items are all assigned to Josh Jennings. These are reports which are just SQL queries.

1. Contract Received Report.
2. AC - 2nd Agreement Report.
3. Payment Report.
4. Payment Report - Monthly Recert.
5. Trace w/Phone & Email report.

It looks like the first item is in SharePoint under "20250722 - Contract Received Report". Can I get confirmation that these have been completed
