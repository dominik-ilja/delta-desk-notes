# Orical Meeting - 2025-10-22 - Wednesday

Here's the outline for the Orical meeting:

1. Go over the different options for handling events for Madeline
2. See if Zabelle was successful in adding her event with Audio. Are there any questions or concerns related to this?
3. See if Zabelle was content with my response to her question about the team member bios

---

This meeting is to cover the different options as described in the email.

- Zabelle
    - Were you successful in adding in the Event with the audio? Is there anything that you'd want to do differently.
    - Did the email I sent about the bios make sense? I looked in Sanity and was unable to find any previous versions.
- Madeline
    - What did you think of the different options that I presented to you?
    - Show demo of the issue.
        - Show the phone number of my contact with the "dominik@deltadesk.com" email
        - Try to create a new contact:
            - Name: Dominik Kulak
            - Email: example@email.com
            - SMS: 814-434-7927
        - Highlight the error
        - The reason they do this is to not send duplicate messages to the same number. If you have multiple people on your list with the same number and you do an SMS campaign, then that number would get multiple hits.
    - Solutions
        1. We could remove the phone number from the event sign-up. This is the simplest and most straightforward solution.
        2. We could look into other services that are better suited for events. This would take time to research and implement but could allow us to get both an email and phone number.
        3. We could keep things the way they are but have more descriptive emails sent to you. This could cause frustration for a user signing up when their phone number and email don't match. We'd miss more sign-ups.

Hello everyone,

This is what we're going to do on our end to follow-up on:

- We are going to have our developer look into what issues might come up, if any, from removing the phone number in the event sign-up. We'll report back his findings. If we're comfortable, then we can remove the phone number from the sign-up.
- We will look into alternative services for handling your events. Potential options that we discussed in the meeting were Constant Contact and Salesforce. We'll report back potential alternatives. You can review on your end and once we decide on something, then we will look into setting up the new service.

If there was anything else you wanted to add, please let me know.

Thank you,
