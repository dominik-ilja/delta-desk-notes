# Josh Jennings

He was making around $500,000 at his previous company.

---

He wants to grow his company. They've started working with a ton of team and have a team of international people. He has good and bad developers. They want to be able to do things quickly in an assembly line kind of fashion. Some folks don't think through the requirements and have to re-work things. Currently, looking for investor money.

He's been in software for 20+ years. Has been using templates for 10+ years. He's been on the business side of companies in programming.

## Topics to follow up on

### Archive

- I bought the book, "When Genius Failed"
- I also started watch the testing section.
    - I bet it really resonated with you when he talked about tests wasting his time now and in the future.
- What are your expectations at Delta Desk?
    - I'm willing to be flexible in my role. I have been put into a lot of different positions at DataSeers which would allow me to be valuable in different areas. I can assist in project management, creating automations, design, frontend, and backend development. I can also learn whatever new skills to help in areas we need it. I'm adaptable and can learn quickly.
- When I first start at Delta Desk, I'm going to have a plan:
    - Learn about everything
        - Learn who everyone is:
            - Co-workers
            - Clients
            - Other important people
        - What is the structure of the company?
        - Learn what the current processes and procedures are
        - Learn what are tech stack is
        - Who are our clients? What clients are more important than others
        - What projects do we currently manage?
            - What is actively in development?
            - What is being maintained?
        - How do we currently get new projects?
        - How do requirements get generated?
        - How are the codebases maintained?
        - What are problem areas that we have?
    - Contributing
        - Requirement gathering from clients
        - Contributions to the code base
        - Ownership of some feature requests
        - Working with developers to understand painpoints and how they do things
        - Proposals to solving pain points

The technologies I'm very comfortable with are:

- HTML
- CSS and related technologies like SASS, Less, CSS Modules, and Tailwind
- JavaScript/TypeScript/Node
- React
- Git
- Figma
- ClickUp for project management - This is what I used until I moved my things local with Obsidian

I have been exposed to a lot of different technologies like MySQL, Bash, Docker, etc., but have varying levels of familiarity. My familiarity with something really comes down to have I had a need to use this tool or not.

Most of my experience lies in frontend development, but I'm completely open to going into topics I don't know much about if it means I'm going to be able to solve my problems or have a better understanding of a topic. To give you an idea, some things I've done which fall into this are:

- Fixed SVG graphics exported from Figma that were incorrectly rendering
- Created an automation to log into my email, parse an email, upload the data to a database, and send a confirmation of the operation on a re-occurring basis with cronjobs.
- Setup custom e-mail domains to better understand how the domain name service worked
- Automated the creation of Figma components with a to prevent issues when changing between components
- Automated the creation of digital asset distribution for DataSeers. A part of this was learning Adobe Illustrator's severely under-documented scripting language.

That being said, there are holes in my knowledge base. I don't know everything. There are I don't have much experience with building applications at scale.

    - Almost getting robbed by four guys
    - People getting killed

### January 7, 2024

Said that part of the reason he got divorced was because his then wife and mother in law would stay up all night while he was trying to sleep and they had a new born baby. His mother in law came to stay with them when they were living in New York. They had a 1 bed 1 bath so there was little space.
