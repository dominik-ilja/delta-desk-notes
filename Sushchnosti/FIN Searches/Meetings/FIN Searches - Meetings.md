**To Discuss:**

One of the big things that has been a struggle is testing all the different items that come down the pipeline from the developers. There's a lot of admin features that are currently ready to be tested. It would be greatly beneficial in getting things done faster for you to help us test and verify that things are working properly.

Here's how this would work:

- When a large feature comes through like the migration of the admin controls, there's going to be a lot of items to review. After the developer has done his initial round of testing, we'll merge it into the QA environment. I believe that you should have access to it.
- I will tell you when these things have been added and give you information about what was done. You guys can go in and see if it is working the way you expect it or not.
- You give me your feedback and we can get that back into the developers hands and this will repeat until you're content with it.
- We will then merge these items into production.
