# Questions for Developers
## Check-ins

**Understanding their work:**

- What are you working on right now, and how is it going?
- Are there any blockers or dependencies slowing you down?
- Do you have everything you need to complete this work?
- What part of this task is proving most challenging?

**Resource and support needs:**

- What tools, documentation, or access do you need that you don't currently have?
- Would pair programming or a code review help with this problem?
- Is there someone specific whose input would be valuable here?
- Are there any meetings or interruptions affecting your focus time?

**Scope and priority clarity:**

- Are the requirements clear, or do you need clarification on anything?
- How does this task fit into the bigger picture?
- If you had to cut scope due to time constraints, what would be least important?
- Are there any assumptions you're making that we should validate?

**Workload and wellbeing:**

- How's your current workload feeling - sustainable or overwhelming?
- What's energizing you in your work right now?
- What's draining or frustrating you?
- How can I better support your professional growth?

**Process improvement:**

- What's working well in our current process?
- What slows down your productivity that we could improve?
- How could our team communication be more effective?
- What would make your day-to-day work smoother?

The key is asking these questions regularly in one-on-ones rather than only when problems arise, and then actually following through on addressing the issues they raise.
