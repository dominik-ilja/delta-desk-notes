**To Josh:**
I also wanted to let you know that the Azure resources have been switched to private for the NEOS project. Bao updated it in QA first. There were no issues. He then updated it in production. All of that is locked down now

I created the ClickUp ticket and tagged Josh in it. I'm going to also send a message to the senior developers chat. I should create a task to check up on this in a couple of days
