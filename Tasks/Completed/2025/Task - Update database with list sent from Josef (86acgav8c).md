        - [x] Get reminded by Mikhail what's happening with this. Is it going to be updating these entries with just the sponsor code?

    - [x] Send Mikhail message about this. [Completed:: 2025-10-23T08:46]

## Meetings

[[Sushchnosti/National Student Debt Forgiveness Center/Customer Relationship Management/Meetings/2025-10-23 - Thursday]]

## Notes

- No the whole organization should not be considered sponsored. It should only be the specific department. The organization and organization department have their own separate `IsSponsor` columns.

## Logs
### Thursday, October 23, 2025

Currently, in the system, we don't have a way to specify who's sponsoring a specific organization department. 

I sent the questions to Josef. - Thursday, October 23, 2025 @ 09:38 AM
