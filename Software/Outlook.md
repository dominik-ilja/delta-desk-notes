# Outlook

- Editing the subject line creates a "new email". It will show the email history in Outlook for the sender, but the receiver will not have any reference to this. The sender will be able to see the prior history, but will not be able to respond to it.
- You can "reply" to any portion of the email chain, but it'll simply be included at the end.
- Forwarding an email will show it in the email chain, but will not be visible to anyone other than the specified recipients.
- Copied emails will receive updates, but will not show an unread status.
- You can search for a category with: `category:"{category}"` where `{category}` is the category you're searching for. This does a partial match. You can also search for multiple categories at once like this: `category:"To Review" OR category:"To Document"`

```
category:"Add to ClickUp" OR
category:"Awaiting Response" OR
category:"Important" OR
category:"Incomplete" OR
category:"Task" OR
category:"To Document" OR
category:"To Respond" OR
category:"To Review"
```
