- [x] Put together an email and send to Matt [Completed:: 2025-11-25T21:49]

Hello everyone,

I wanted to share our priorities:

1. Performance and loading time of pages
2. Migration of admin features and login
3. Document loading improvements and fixes
4. Universal search improvements
5. Global search input improvements
6. Firms and 13F data fixes
7. User activity tracking improvements
8. Institutional side of Salesforce integration

We'll tackle these one at a time. If any critical bugs or issues arise, please report them in the ClickUp forms and we'll address them. If we need to adjust priorities, we'll need to discuss what has to be deprioritized for it.

Please reach out with any questions.

Regards,
