    - [ ] [@Dominik Kulak](https://deltadesk.slack.com/team/U09D6PBEHMM) one item we had discussed that I am not sure if it ended up as a ticket was checking on what was left to do with the salesforce CRM integration. I believe the RIA side was done and it was just the institutional side that had to be wrapped up?
